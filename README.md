# Minimum Requirements
Java 8 - This program uses Java 8's streams and lamda functions.
# Building
Checkout from github:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/thakkargourav/skiing_singapore.git
```
Build using maven:
```sh
mvn clean package
```
# Running
You can download the latest jar from [Releases](https://github.com/thakkargourav/skiing_singapore/releases) or build yourself using the command provided above.

You can run the jar using following command:
```sh
java -jar skiing-singapore-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar pathToFile
```
* -d (optional) is a parameter flag for dictionary. It should be used if user wants to override default dictionary
* pathToDatafiles.. (optional) is parameter for data files. A user can specify a list of paths for data files separated by " "(space). If no file is passed as parameter, then the program will ask for number using STDIN.

Running without a data file, will result in reading data from stdin:
```sh
java -jar 1800-coding-challenge-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar -d dict.txt
```
Or alternatively, you can run it with a data file:
```sh
java -jar 1800-coding-challenge-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar example1.txt example2.txt
```
